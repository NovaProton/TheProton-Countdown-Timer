# TheProton Countdown Timer

This project is a customizable countdown timer that allows users to set hours and minutes, visually represented with a water animation that fills the screen as the countdown progresses. Itâ€™s a simple yet effective way to track time, featuring offline capability for consistent usage.

## Features
- **Customizable Countdown**: Set a timer using hours and minutes to track events or tasks.
- **Persistent Countdown**: The timer continues even if the page is refreshed, using session storage to keep track of the countdown.
- **Water Animation**: As time passes, a water element fills up, providing a visual indicator of time progression.
- **Responsive Layout**: The interface adapts to different screen sizes, offering a user-friendly experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Info Button**: An easy-to-access button provides instructions on how to use the countdown timer.
- **Service Worker for Offline Capability**: Uses a service worker to cache essential files, allowing the timer to be used offline.
